  "Considerations": [
    "During peak business hours, there might be a high volume of legitimate traffic passing through the firewall, which could trigger alerts due to the sheer number of events logged.",
    "Routine network maintenance or updates might generate a large number of firewall events, leading to false positives. Ensure to correlate with maintenance schedules before raising an alert.",
    "Incorrect or overly broad firewall rules might log benign traffic as suspicious, causing false alerts. Verify the firewall configuration to rule out this possibility."
